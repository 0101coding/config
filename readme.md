This configurations were setup on MACOS

It assumes the use of a fish terminal with Alacrity

It also assumes accessing a vm -ubuntu in this case - and adjusting the configurations on the vm's configuration. There is a relationship between the vim devicons configuration and the font settings in the alacritty configuration file.


This is a basic configuration that is bound to grow over time.



Alacritty terminal was further beautified with the use of alacritty-themes, which was installed via npm package manager - However since somehow it was accessible on the terminal, i createed a symlink from the Cellar directory to the /usr/local/bin.

Most of the configuration were from other Developers, but the whole inspiration and most of the configurations came from [**Jon Gjengset**](https://github.com/jonhoo)
